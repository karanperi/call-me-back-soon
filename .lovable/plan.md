## Important Context About `.env` in This Project

This project runs on Lovable Cloud, which **automatically manages the `.env` file**. It's generated by the platform and contains only the project's publishable keys (the anon key and project URL — these are designed to be public). There are no private secrets in this file.

### What this means:

1. **The `.env` file cannot be edited or deleted** — Lovable Cloud regenerates it automatically
2. **The values in it are not secret** — `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` are public by design (they're embedded in the built frontend JavaScript anyway)
3. **There is no need to add `.env` to `.gitignore`** — the platform manages this file, and its contents are safe to commit
4. **Git history rewriting is not possible** from within Lovable — that requires running `git filter-branch` or `bfb-cleaner` locally on a cloned copy of the repo

### What about forkers?

When someone forks the repo and sets up their own backend, they'll replace these values with their own project credentials. The publishable key in the current `.env` only grants access scoped by your RLS policies — it cannot be used to read/write data without proper authentication.

### Revised recommendation:

Since the `.env` contains only publishable keys and is auto-managed, **no action is needed on `.env`**. The real security focus should be on:

1. Adding JWT auth to `deepgram-proxy` and `parse-voice-reminder`
2. Sanitizing sensitive console.log statements in edge functions
3. Encrypting PII fields in the database

Shall we proceed with adding authentication to the unprotected edge functions instead?
